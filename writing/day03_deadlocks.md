## Abstract

Deadlock in database-backed web applications could involve different numbers of HTTP request,and they could be caused by locks explicitly requested in applicaion code or implicitly requeted by databases during query execution. To help developers understand these deadlocks and guide the design of tools for combating these deadlocks, we conduct a characteristic study with 49 deadlocks collected from real-world web applications developed following different programming paradigms. We provide categorization results based on HTTP request numbers and resource types, with a special focus on categorizing deadlocks on database locks. We expect our results to be useful for application developers to understand web-application deadlocks and for tool researchers to design comprehensive support for combating web-application deadlocks.
