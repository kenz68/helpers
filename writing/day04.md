Dear Jonathan,

I understand that you want to hire someone to work in your Accouting Department.
I have worked as an accountant at the Hiram Company for five years.
Could you please send the job application? Also, I would like to know when
the job will begin?

Thank you very much for your help.

Sincerily,

Kenz

#### 3. opinion
In recent years, people can easily find company's information through not only newspaper advertisements,
personal recommendations but also on the internet. As far as I am concerned, despite several useful methods 
to get a job, I opt for a job which is found on the internet especially on social networks like Facebook and Instagram
and I am going to make my statement clear in this essay.

First of all, a job found on the social network is usually suitable for an invididual's interest.
There is no doubt that social networks are now known by the majority of the population all 
around the world and play an imperative part in everyone's life. Hence, advertisements ralating to 
occupation on Facebook or Instagram not only easy approach applicants but also casually base on
the categories that interest users. To illustrate this, based on people's searching on social networks
such as cooking or business, the advertisements involving this particular filed will consequently
exist on thier new feed.

Secondlly, Regarding specific spheres, without any difficuty, people can access the enterprise throught the content
of advertisements or thier page on Facebook or another social filed with just one click. This reason is that
if content indicates sincerely the enterprise's strenght or thier good potential, it is absolutely a greate job 
that applicants should take into account.

To conclude, Although there are a variaty ways to find a job, from my point of view, social networks have
a significant strenght compared to other methods.
